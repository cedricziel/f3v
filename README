# f3v - A vagrant box for testing FLOW3

As it is a very disappointing to try a framework in point of configuring your environment, vagrant to the rescue!

## What does it?

It sucks the lucid basebox from vagrantup.com, installs a basic nginx/php-fpm environment on it and enables you to open your project in the browser right away.

## How does it do this?

As a prerequesite, you should have vagrant installed. For a quick jump-in, just install the vagrant ruby gem.

	$ gem install vagrant

You will probably want to install this vagrant box as a submodule in your current FLOW3-project:

	$ git submodule add git://github.com/cedricziel/f3v.git vagrant

Your sourcecode should be placed in a src subfolder. Otherwise edit the option in the Vagrantfile.

## Warning
This should not harm your project, but it can. Please take care.
